# Vehicle to Everything (V2X) - Mobile As GPS

A new idea to get Latitude and Longitude using [Mobile - Raspberry Pi], I created in the Graduation Project (V2X). \
We tried to use a GPS module, but it was so slow and not accurate. \
So, we create a new idea to get the location of the vehicle, Traffic light or the garage, by using the GPS of the Mobile and sharing its reads via Bluetooth "serial communication" between the Mobile phone and Raspberry Pi.
